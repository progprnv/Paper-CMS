Build a comprehensive Flask-based Research Paper Repository & Publication Management System called "Paper CMS" that handles the complete academic workflow from paper submission through peer review to final decision. The system must support three user roles (Authors, Reviewers, Administrators) with role-specific dashboards and workflows. Use Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM configured for MySQL (required, no SQLite) as the backend, with Jinja2 templates and Bootstrap 5 for the frontend responsive design. Implement authentication using Flask-Login with session management and include basic security features like Werkzeug password hashing and Flask-WTF forms with CSRF protection.

For the database schema, create SQLAlchemy models with these core entities: Users (with id, name, email, password_hash, and role as Author/Reviewer/Admin), Papers (with id, title, abstract, status, submission_date, file_path, conference_id), Authors as a many-to-many relationship between Users and Papers, Reviews (with id, paper_id, reviewer_id, score, comments, recommendation, review_date), Conferences (with id, name, year, submission_deadline, status), Categories (id, name, description), PaperCategories as a many-to-many relationship between Papers and Categories, and Affiliations (id, user_id, institution_name, department). Use Python enums for user roles and review recommendations, implement proper foreign key constraints and indexes, configure bidirectional relationships in SQLAlchemy, and include cascade delete rules for dependent records.

Set up an authentication and authorization system with user registration featuring email/password validation, role-based access control using Flask-Login, password hashing with Werkzeug security, session management with secure cookies, and route protection decorators for different user roles. Implement core application routes and features including author routes (/dashboard for viewing submitted papers with status tracking, /submit-paper for paper upload form with multiple authors/categories, /paper/<id> for viewing paper details and review feedback, and /profile for managing personal information and affiliations), reviewer routes (/reviewer/dashboard for assigned papers queue with deadlines, /review/<paper_id> for review submission form with scoring, and /review-history for past reviews and feedback), and admin routes (/admin/dashboard for system overview and metrics, /admin/users for user management and role assignment, /admin/papers for bulk paper management and status updates, /admin/assign-reviewers for manual reviewer assignment interface, and /admin/conferences for conference management and deadlines). Include shared functionality like advanced search and filtering by category, author, status, and conference; paper status tracking with visual indicators; average score calculation and display; and PDF viewer integration for paper access.

Create a frontend template structure using Jinja2 with base.html as the main layout featuring Bootstrap 5, navigation, and flash messages; auth/ directory for login, registration, and password reset; dashboard/ directory for role-specific dashboards (author.html, reviewer.html, admin.html); papers/ directory for paper submission, detail view, and search results; reviews/ directory for review forms and assignment interface; and admin/ directory for user management and system configuration. Ensure the UI/UX meets requirements including responsive Bootstrap 5 design supporting mobile devices, consistent navigation with role-based menu items, flash message system for user feedback, accessible form design with proper validation states, and loading indicators for async operations.

Implement advanced features including file management with secure PDF upload featuring type validation, file storage organization by conference/year, download protection with access control, and file size limits; workflow automation with email notifications for review assignments and deadlines, paper status transition automation, deadline tracking and escalation, and bulk operations for conference management; and security enhancements including input sanitization and XSS protection, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries, rate limiting on authentication endpoints, and secure headers configuration.

Structure the project with the following organization: paperflow-cms/app/ directory containing __init__.py, models.py for SQLAlchemy models, routes.py for Flask route handlers, forms.py for WTForms definitions, auth.py for authentication utilities, utils.py for helper functions, templates/ directory with auth/, dashboard/, papers/, reviews/, and admin/ subdirectories for Jinja2 templates, and static/ directory containing css/, js/, and uploads/ subdirectories. Include config.py for configuration classes, requirements.txt for Python dependencies, run.py as the application entry point, schema.sql for MySQL database schema, and README.md with setup instructions. Configure environment-based settings for development/production, MySQL connection pooling, secret key management, file upload configuration, and email service integration.

Follow this implementation priority: Phase 1 (Foundation) focusing on database models and relationships, user authentication system, basic paper submission and listing, and role-based dashboard skeletons; Phase 2 (Core Workflows) implementing complete review assignment and submission, paper status management, search and filtering capabilities, and admin user management; Phase 3 (Enhanced Features) adding file upload system, email notifications, advanced admin controls, and mobile optimization; and Phase 4 (Production Ready) completing security hardening, performance optimization, comprehensive testing, and deployment configuration.
